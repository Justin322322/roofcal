## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Test Your Backups:** Always verify backups work by testing restore
2. **Off-site Storage:** Consider uploading backups to cloud storage (S3, GCS)
3. **Before Migrations:** Always backup before running database migrations
4. **Railway Database:** Get DATABASE_URL from Railway dashboard → Database → Variables

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"mysqldump: command not found"**
→ Install MySQL client tools (see Quick Start step 1)

**"DATABASE_URL not set"**
→ Add to `.env` file from Railway dashboard

**"Connection failed"**
→ Verify Railway database is running and DATABASE_URL is correct

**Need more help?**
→ Run `npm run backup:setup` for detailed diagnostics

## ✅ Next Steps

1. Run `npm run backup:setup` to verify everything is ready
2. Create your first backup: `npm run backup:db:compress`
3. Set up GitHub Actions by adding DATABASE_URL to secrets
4. Schedule regular backups (daily recommended)
