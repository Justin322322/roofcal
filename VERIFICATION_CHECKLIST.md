# Production Migration Verification Checklist

## Immediate Actions (Do Now)

- [ ] **1. Go to Vercel Dashboard**
  - URL: https://vercel.com/dashboard
  - Find the `roofcal` project
  - Click on the latest deployment

- [ ] **2. Check Build Logs**
  - Look for: `prisma migrate deploy`
  - Should see: "All migrations have been successfully applied"
  - Should see: "11 migrations found in prisma/migrations"
  - If you see errors, note them down

- [ ] **3. Wait for Deployment to Complete**
  - Usually takes 1-2 minutes
  - Status should change from "Building" to "Ready"

## After Deployment Completes

### Test 1: API Endpoint
- [ ] **Run this command:**
  ```bash
  curl https://roofcal.vercel.app/api/notifications
  ```
- [ ] **Expected Result:** Status 401 (Not authenticated)
- [ ] **If you get 500:** Migration didn't work - see troubleshooting

### Test 2: Browser Test
- [ ] **Open browser:** https://roofcal.vercel.app
- [ ] **Log in** with your credentials
- [ ] **Click the notification bell icon** (top right)
- [ ] **Expected:** Notification center opens without errors
- [ ] **Check browser console** (F12) for any errors

### Test 3: Create a Test Notification
- [ ] **Navigate to a project**
- [ ] **Trigger an action** that creates a notification
- [ ] **Check notification center** - new notification should appear
- [ ] **Click on the notification** - should navigate correctly

### Test 4: Check Error Logs
- [ ] **Go to Vercel dashboard**
- [ ] **Click on "Functions" tab**
- [ ] **Look for any recent errors**
- [ ] **Check `/api/notifications` logs**
- [ ] **Should see no 500 errors**

## Success Indicators

✅ Deployment completed successfully
✅ Build logs show migration applied
✅ API returns 401 (not 500)
✅ Notification center loads
✅ No errors in browser console
✅ No errors in Vercel logs

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Issue: Migration didn't run
**Solution:** See `scripts/run-production-migration.md` for manual steps

### Issue: API still returns 500
**Solution:** 
1. Check Vercel logs for specific error
2. Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
3. Try triggering another deployment

### Issue: Table already exists error
**Solution:** This is safe to ignore - table was already created
