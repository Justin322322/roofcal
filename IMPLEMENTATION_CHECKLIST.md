### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Database migration tested on staging
- [ ] Email notifications tested on staging
- [ ] Documentation reviewed

### Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Backup production database
2. [ ] Run database migration: `npx prisma db push`
3. [ ] Regenerate Prisma client: `npx prisma generate`
4. [ ] Deploy code changes
5. [ ] Verify API endpoint is accessible
6. [ ] Test cancellation on production (with test project)
7. [ ] Verify email notifications work
8. [ ] Verify in-app notifications work
9. [ ] Monitor error logs

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor for errors in first 24 hours
- [ ] Check email delivery rates
- [ ] Verify notification system working
- [ ] Collect user feedback
- [ ] Document any issues found

## üìä Metrics to Monitor

### Usage Metrics
- [ ] Number of projects cancelled per day
- [ ] Cancellation rate (cancelled / total accepted)
- [ ] Client vs contractor cancellation ratio
- [ ] Most common cancellation reasons
- [ ] Time between acceptance and cancellation

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] API response time for cancel endpoint
- [ ] Email delivery success rate
- [ ] Notification creation success rate
- [ ] Error rate for cancel operations
- [ ] Database query performance

## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

- [ ] None identified yet (to be updated during testing)

## üìù Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add cancellation analytics dashboard
- [ ] Add ability to view cancellation history
- [ ] Add cancellation reason categories/dropdown

- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] Clean, maintainable code
- [ ] All tests passing (pending)
- [ ] Successfully deployed to production (pending)
- [ ] No critical bugs in first week (pending)

## üìû Support Information

### If Issues Arise
1. Check error logs in browser console
2. Check server logs for API errors
3. Verify database connection
4. Check email service status
5. Verify Prisma client is up to date
6. Contact development team

### Rollback Plan
If critical issues found:
1. Revert code changes
2. Keep database schema (CANCELLED status is harmless)
3. Projects already cancelled will remain cancelled
4. No data loss expected
